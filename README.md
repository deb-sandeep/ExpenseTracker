# ExpenseTracker
###### An Android application to capture daily expenses.

An expense tracker created more out of necessity than need. The necessity was that of a simple expense capture mobile application with the following features:

1. Minimal footprint
2. Rapid (minimal touch) expense entry
3. Easy modification of expenses
  * Adding amount to existing expense
  * Deleting existing expense
  * Cloning existing expenses
4. Customizable expense categories and sub-categories
5. Expense report view - category/sub-category grouping
6. Export expense report as CSV
